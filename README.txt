NEWSFEED PROJECT

URL: http://www.se.rit.edu/~lvs1646/344/NewsfeedProject/index.php
Version Control: https://github.com/lauravsilva/344-IndividualNewsfeed

NOTES: 
- The user can log in to the application on http://www.se.rit.edu/~lvs1646/344/NewsfeedProject/index.php, and upon approved credentials, they are redirected to /dashboard.php.
- The data file has an already created user "dan" with password "test" with some stories already favorited for testing.
- Stories can be unfavorited from the button on the newsfeed or from the "x" on the favorites list.

KNOWN BUG:
- Sometimes the AJAX call to favorite an item doesn't immediately work. Upon refreshing the page, the site will update the data and favoriting should work as expected after that.
